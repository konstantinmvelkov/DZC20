# DZC20
## The workflow is as follows:
## 1. Clone the repository locally (you will clone the develop branch as it is set as the main branch).
## 2. Go to where you cloned the repository to and open Assets/Scenes.
## 3. Click on any file with .unity type to start your project.
## 4. Make changes.
## 5. Commit changes.
## 6. Fetch from the remote repository.
## 7. If the remote is some commits ahead, then pull and merge locally (resolve conflicts if there are any).
## 8. Push to remote repository.
## Done! 
## Once we are happy with work done at some point, we merge develop into master. (master will keep only the 'release')
#### Project is done for the final assignment of DZC20 course.
