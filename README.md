### 4. Make changes.🛠
### 5. Commit changes.💫
### 6. Fetch from the remote repository.🔄
### 7. If the remote is some commits ahead, then pull and merge locally (resolve conflicts if there are any). ⚠️

## Done! 🏆
## Once we are happy with work done at some point, we merge develop into master. (master will keep only the 'release') 👌
